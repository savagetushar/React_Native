 What is CRUD?

These are the four basic operations used in apps to interact with databases or APIs.

In a React Native app, CRUD is usually done by communicating with a backend API (like Node.js, Django, Firebase, etc.) using HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) through libraries like Axios or fetch.
